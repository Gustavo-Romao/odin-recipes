    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>The best sweet ever made (in my opinion), a simple and small ball of creamy chocolate and happiness, i actually recommend trying making one of those at home. Here's how you can do it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 box of condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted margarine</li>
        <li>7 tablespoons of chocolate milk or 4 tablespoons of chocolate powder</li>
        <li>chocolate sprinkles</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Method of preparation</h3>
    <p>In a deep pan, add the condensed milk, margarine and chocolate powder. Cook over medium heat and stir until the brigadeiro starts to come away from the pan. Let it cool and make small balls with your hands by passing the dough into the chocolate sprinkles.</p>
