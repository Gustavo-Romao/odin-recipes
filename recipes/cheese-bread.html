    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite recipes for a afternoon, consist in a small ball of crispy bread with a melting cheese inside. It's easy to make, and it's really tasty. Goes well with butter, and a cup of coffee.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 cups (American) of sweet cassava starch (500 g)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon seasoning or salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 glasses (American) of milk (300 ml)</li>
        <li>1 cup (American) of oil (150 ml)</li>
        <li>2 large or 3 small eggs</li>
        <li>4 cups (American) grated half-cured Minas cheese</li>
        <li>oil for greasing</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Method of preparation</h3>
    <p>Place the cassava starch in a large bowl and set aside. Heat the salt, milk and oil and when this mixture boils, use it to blanch the tapioca starch, stir very well to break up lumps. Let cool. Add the eggs, one by one, alternating with the cheese and kneading well after each addition. Grease your hands with oil if necessary. Roll up 2 cm diameter dumplings and place them on a greased baking tray. Place in a preheated medium oven (180ยบ C). Bake until the cheese breads are golden brown.</p>
